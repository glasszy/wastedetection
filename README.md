# Smart Waste Detection System using YOLOv8 and CNN

## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize urban waste management in the Philippines by leveraging **real-time image processing** and **deep learning**. By combining **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once version 8) with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, we propose an automated waste detection system that classifies various waste types with high accuracyâ€”even in challenging environments.

## Running the Program

If you want to run the program using a webcam, run **webcam with cnn.py**. If you simply want to upload an imaage, run **upload with cnn.py**
